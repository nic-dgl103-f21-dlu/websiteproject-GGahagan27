          <p>
            At Moon's Records, we are passionate about music. We believe that
            vinyl records deliver a superior listening experience, which is why
            we carry vinyl exclusively. We carry a wide selection of records in
            all genres, (from ? different word?) collector's items and original
            pressings, reissues, and new releases. Moon's carries Albums, EP's,
            single's, and box-sets. Whatever your musical tastes, there is
            something for everyone at Moon's. At Moon's, we also have special DJ
            discounts through our frequent buyer program. In addition, if you
            are looking for something and that don't have it, our team members
            can help you track it down.
