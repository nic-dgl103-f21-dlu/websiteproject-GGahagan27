          <h3>The High Quadra Ramblers</h3>
          <p>
            Taking their name from a street in Victoria, BC, the High Quadra
            Ramblers bring their inspired take on high-energy music that draws
            influences from their Cape Breton Celtic roots to the West Coast.
            The Ramblers combine celt, bluegrass, ragtime, metis, and classical
            and put their own spin on traditional music.
